# Advent of Code (December 2025)

Michaiah Williams

A few things
- this is a new language for me, so I'm sorry if I'm not following conventions 
- this is designed to get the answer as quickly as possible and may not be the most professional (nested loops go crazy lol)
- obviously, don't look at these if you don't want spoilers for Advent of Code!!
- each day is in its own directory and represents the solution for the last task of that day (so not the first half)
- I intend to finish every day but I don't know if they'll all be on time
- have fun :D
